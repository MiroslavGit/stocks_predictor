# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

This project is a straightforward yet effective implementation of a stock price prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks with the Keras library. The model is trained on historical stock price data to forecast future stock prices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Python Installation:** Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download and install Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).

- **Library Installation:** Install the required Python libraries using the following command:

  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib keras scikit-learn

###  Dataset
To use this model, you'll need historical stock price data in CSV format. The code assumes the existence of a file named "all_stocks_5yr.csv." Replace this file with your dataset, ensuring it contains columns like 'date' and 'close' for the date and closing stock prices.

## Running the Code
Follow these steps to run the stock price prediction code:

### Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
Modify the Data Path:
Open your Python script and find the line data=pd.read_csv("all_stocks_5yr.csv"). Replace "all_stocks_5yr.csv" with the correct path to your dataset.

### Execute the Script:

In VS Code use F5, make sure you have python extenstions etc...

### Results and Visualization
Upon execution, the script will generate predictions for future stock prices. You can visualize the results by plotting predicted prices against the actual stock prices for a comprehensive analysis.

### Contributing
Feel free to contribute to the project by opening issues or pull requests. Any feedback, suggestions, or improvements are welcome!
